      <h2>Hello to whoever on my site.</h2>

        <h3>Leadership</h3>
        <p>Working with entreprenurship for few years, and joining a team of people to build up a company

        <h3>Tennis is love</h3>
        <p>I started playing tennis at the age of 10 and immediately fell in love with the sport.
        playing tennis teaches you alot. It teaches you to trust yourself, believe and have confidence when you are
        on the field. There is alot of fun in playing tennis, it is a real unique sport.</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>I am adding programming to this skill list even tho it is a new thing I recently picked up.
          I really wish i picked up programming at a younger age. But being 24 and starting off now
          should not be that bad well?
          Html and Css is going pretty well so far and I am excited to start working with Javascript soon.
          I have also bought advanced css, javascript, php, react, machine learning, python and ios bootcamp
          courses at udemy. There is total of over 300 hours of lessons/courses I will go thru.</p>
